# ML3-Split the Bill

** Official GitLab Repo at https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/CS207_Spring2021/ml3-split-the-bill/-/tree/dev ** 

**Names:** Caroline Carey, Jason Few, Jake Rosen, Natalie Sanchez, Jason Talpalar, & Blake Underwood

**Goals**  
- Create an app that allows a person to take a picture of the bill after eating at a restaurant, and using CoreML image processing, breaks down the items ordered, allowing the user to check off who ordered what. The app calculates how much each person owes.  
- Equal delegation of work between teammates.  
- Use materials and concepts covered in class.  
- Make the app user-friendly.

**Features**  
- CoreML Image Processing.  
- Table View with cells that include food item and cost.  
- Button that will allow for the addition of users.
- Color-code each user's items with highlighting on the Table View.  
- Ability to edit items in Table View if parsed out incorrectly.

**How it works**  
1. The user will take a picture of the bill with his or her iOS Mobile Device to be processed using CoreML.  
2. Each line on the bill is parsed out in a table view that can be edited.  
3. The user adds and selects a person with the "add person" button; the user can select the item(s) he or she will be paying for. Tax and tip will be able to be adjusted at the top of the screen.  
4. A final screen outputting how much each person owes appears with tax and tip included.  

**Meetings:** Wednesdays at 7:00pm
